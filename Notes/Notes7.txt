Week 3
Intro to HTML and CSS

Elements:
HTML is a document (plain text file)
they are made of tags
hyper text mark up language
file formats tells the computer how to open it
derived from xml (xml is ooolllddd)
xml was made to store data
in xml you make up the tags. (for catogoerizing)
HTML is just made to organize things
HTML is just the bones
a tag is just a <insert tag here></insert tag here>
the browser is the only thing that can open an HTML the way it is supposed to be viewed
W3C world wide web consordium
They decide the rules that will apply to HTML
New versions of HTML are just new rulesets
Also have attributes= ways of storing other information
common attributes:
class-Name things (you can reuse it)useful for css so you can add the same thing to multiple things
id-Name things (javascript)(have to unique) useful for java so you add something to one thing
name-form input fields (drop down menus)
style-dont use it! if you see it its bad 
href
src
Structure elements:
document type aka doc type <!DOCTYPE html>
lower case your tags
HTML <html lan="en"></html>
Head - just for browser(never be renderened on page)<head></head>
Header - is a label
Body- <body></body> everything goes here for your website
browsers had default styles for some elements
normalize(reset to something) or reset(wipes clean) (libraries)

Content Elements
holds or displays your conent
headings h1-biggest text h2 h3 h4 h5 h6-smallest text
paragraph p
link a
image img
span <span> </span> for non layout things
h1 use once h2 use once

Container elements
just for layout
for structyring your page
dividers or organiziers 
div-divider identical to footer header and nav (block level element)will not go along side anything
form-visibily wont do any thing (it will send the data thats in it to some place else)<form action=""
method=""></form>
methods:get and post (get is not secure)post if for private information (it is sent one time one way and encrypts it)and tells the browser that you sent a forum
table-really old way of strucuring your entire layout looks like an excel spreadsheet row column cell
only use a table if your laying out tabulor data (if it looks like a excel speadsheet)
<table>
	<tr>
		<td></td>
		<td></td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		to add a header would be <th></th>
list- <ol> and <ul> ordered list and unordered list li is list item
<ol>
	<li></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li></li>
</ul>
