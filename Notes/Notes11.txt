mdn just google all css selectors

dont use id in your code

, choose diferent selectors and spaces mean descendents

class elements descendent an direct child MAIN SELECTORS

hex and rgba are go tos for color

Display Modes
(built in browser styles)(display modes wont be reset)
the core component to the actual layout
div is and example of a block


Block-
display: block

full width by default
has a physical presence (things can colide with it)

Inline-
display: inline
key differnce inline has no physical presence
it doesnt push elements out of the way
you cant use main properties
can be aligned using text properties (text-align)
in a line of text

Inline-block-
display: inline-block
has a physical presence
primarly inline but you can use all the properties you couldnt with inline
elements will sit side by side
can be aligned using text properties

None-
display: none
this makes your element vanish
turning things on and off

visibility:0 makes your element see through
display: none actually removes it

Floats and clears

should never ever use them
small cases where you can use them
if you can avoid them AVOID THEM
eg; float: left
floats will start to wrap things around your page
value of left right and none

Clear-
eg; clear:left
left right both and none
they sit along side each other

Positioning

Position- 
eg; position: absolute
it moves elements onto a whole new plain
static relative absolute fixed
Z Index-
eg; z-index: 5
can accept negative numbers
great for layering things on top of each other
disadvantage: anytime the page resizes the elements stay in the specific spot
relative-
static-
fixed- keep the element there when you scroll

Reset.css and Normalize.css
Eric Meyer reset.css
google it

reset wipes the board
normalize resets but adds some stuff

CHEATS

</hr> in html and then have css tell what the hr should be
background
border-radius: 50%
border-color: 
border:
line-height: to same value of height
use divs to create profiles
blockquote for quotes
text-align and line-height will help alot for project
contact:
make a div for the input and then display:block so they have the same width once teh first width is set.
