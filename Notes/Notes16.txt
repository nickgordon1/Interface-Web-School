What ia programming?
client side versus server side
client side is vistor side
server side is owner side
front end is all client side
server holds css html and javascript
it lets the user have their browser download from the server the site
everything we are doing is client side
front end you can see with visuals
server side you just have code not images or text
server side youd write your own messages for when something goes wrong
then they make logs that dump all your broken code so you can see it remotely
generate all your own feedback

scripts vs programs

javascript is scripting language

programs are standole
perform tasks independent of other programs

scripts automate the use of programs
tell the computer to use pieces of a program on its own without you telling it what to do

compile code vs interperated code

interperated code is text file that gets translated into machine language by an interpretor (far removed from the actual computer that does things)
the further you are from the metal the more user frienly the code is opposite effect the closer to the metal you are
translating takes power and ram

interpertaed code is what javascript is javascript interperator
the browser has a built in interperator
heavy human to heavy machine

compiled code turns your code directly into machine language
one step removed from interperated
compiled code doesnt work live
it has to be compiled and then used
fairly human readable
it does more then just a simple tarnslation it does a bunch of translations
you have to compile it before using to see if it worked

server side is majority compiled
modern server side code is interperated

programming languages do the same things
