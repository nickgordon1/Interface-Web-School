Bootstrap-

Really good documentation

The Grid:
Responsive mobile first grid system
Predifnined class for easy layout options
Rows and columns
Rows must be in a container
Container class ( changes sizes)
Container-fluid
Horizontal groups of columns
Content should be in columns
Columns create gutters with padding (can be offset with rows)
3 equal columns would be 4
when you apply to smaller sizes it will happen to all the sizes above

Structure element

Container 
Row
Components (cool pieces of stuff)
