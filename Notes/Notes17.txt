object oriented programming
javascript is not object orientated
it doesnt contain the pieces needed to do so
it was written as a scripting language
javascript is based on a ruleset called ECMA script
new script coming out soon ECMA6
ECMA6 is object oriented
it is on the verge to become a true programming language
Javascript can change HTML
It can also change your CSS
Javascipt normally runs after the page is loaded
It needs to alter your HTML and CSS first
You have to tell it when to run...It can load at the wrong time (BAD)
Javascipt can talk to other languages
Javascript does all the heavylifting
Javascript takes a copy of your HTML and converts it into Javasciot variables so it can use it it's way
It can also talk to other servers
most code is on the same server
API - public access layer of an application (Facebook having foreign things in it from another source using the API)
Javascript is MESSY
There isnt a clear and obvious way to do most things
No good documentation for Javascript
Be willing to do different methods
This has nothing to do with Java
Java is a backend programming language

Basic Usage-
The script tag (type,src)
the script tag has a closing tag
no href its src
script src=".."
script tags are a combination of link and style
script has open and close
other attribute type
put in HTML 
similar to link
heading or body
loading bar would be an example of a good place to put a scipt in the head
where you put your script tags 
mysequal
php
mamp-translator
also lamp
Javascript can be ran in the backend
NodeJS server side javascript (interperator)
Node is a back end language
object oriented- variables,arrays,objects(can carry all the above),classes(an object template so it can be used over and over but can change the values), inheritance
its much better to keep it away from your HTML
use an external javascript file
Bottom of the page is where the javascript should good
after libraries
timing with javascript is evreything



<script type="text/javascript">

// A comment

alert ();

</script>

<script src="js/myFile.js"></script>
