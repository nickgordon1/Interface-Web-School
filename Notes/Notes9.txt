cascading style sheet (css)
skin to html bones
contains layout spacing layering
can do animations
its new for animations
its easier than javasript animations
css is rules sets
it is just a plain text file that doesnt nothing on its own
css is simple syntax
SELECTOR
PROPERTY
VALUE

/* comment */

html has commnets aswell . it is multi line <!-- comment -->
front end code is visible to everyone
anybody can look at it at any time
and mess with it
HTML comments are public
USE COMMENTS going forward for projects
HTML coments are rare.
they are handy for notes but not really in the real world

what does it look like?

selector{
propery: value
}

selectors: are the most complex part of css
the selector engine is so powerful it has been made to be used in javascript
jQuery uses css selector engine

sizzle css selector engine is the jQuery selector engine
selector types:
element selector: div {}
class selectors: .myClass {}
id selectors: #myId {}

example for multiple selectors:

div,a,span {} is not the same as div a span {}
.MYCLASS {} is not the same as .myClass {}

refer to slack preston jsbin

jsfiddle like jsbin


PROPERTIES:
get familiar with syntax
properties have dashes which represent spaces
USE BRACKETS it knows the css properties and completes the value
always all lower case
some times can be combines
short hand properties almost always has a group
can all be combined
property order does matter
the bottom of the list is whats applied
eg multiple colors
unique label you can put 


color:orange !important;

!=bang
important markers will overwrite code
don't use them to fix things.
its improper coding css

vendor prefixes:
vendor you slap on to the beggining of the property
early implementations of global browser properties

always start with a dash
-moz
-webkit

ASSIGNMENT!
Practice CSS syntax

more properties

background:  with alot of others with it

color: just for text

font: a bunch of sub properties just like background

border: bunch of sub properties puts a border around an element
use borders in certain display modes

text-align: aligns entire elemenst center left and right

text-decoration: only common to links

most css properties has a value of none
you can always reset a value or property
using to remove a underline to a link or add a underline to text

cursor: this changes the cursor
usually used to turn off and on
pointer (finger)and default(pointer)

* {} : all (select all)

a.green {}

div a {}

div > a {} :direct desendant

a:hover {} will only have things change when hovering over

input[type="text"] {}
