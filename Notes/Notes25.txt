Document outline
it used to structure your page
this is how you structure things without using visuals
HTML Outliner*â€‹ https://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/
More info: symantics book called dive in to html5 posted free online

Linksensure that you have the focus state styled :focus
works on all elements
when your walking through a form and you press tab than tab to the next box an dits highlighted blue thats the focus state
Ensure your links are visiualy distinct
skip to content links
great to use for people who are using alternate browsers for accessability
Dont remove outline styles from links
DONT REMOVE OUTLINES
# is to make sure a page doesnt reload
# marks in the url will tell the browser to skip to that id in the html
these dont animate
it will jump instantly which can be bad :/ 

Images
HTML validator that all img tags ahave an alt attribute 
alt="" (it will read the value of the alt text on other browsers for accessability eg. screen reader)
you can style this text as well
you have to put an alt attribute to all img tasg to me valid
Make sure they support retina displays
saving all the images to exactly 2x the size and downscaling with image
Image is a background and needs an alt attribute
youll need a sr-only

JavaScript
dont use inline scripts
dont use attributes like on load
there are browsers that wont except them
Consider supporting node javascript browsers
use accessable libraries

Forms
use a logical order for the form
use a tabindex=1 it sets the order that the form tabs to next
always use label elements
dont use placeholders without labels
once they type in it they cant see what it is
group related elements with field set
this will seperate the form
legends are used to label the field set

Audio/Video
another reason to not host your own video
have a text transcript for the video
provide syncronize subtitles
YouTube has it built in
in general have text replacements for all media
This is great for podcasts

Color and Contrast
test your site for its color and contrast
there should be enough contrast that you can see it in black and white
easy to test
Test for different tyoes of blindess
colorblind or otherwise

Testing
not use the mouse when traversing your website
using a screen reader on your site
use your voice to navigate using those tools
download the AT tools and use them for yourself
most of them cost money
